# Home Maintenance Scheduler

A single-page web app to plan bimonthly maintenance visits with a per-visit time cap.

## Features
- Add tasks with minutes, fixed category, and frequency.
- Persist tasks and time limit via localStorage.
- Build a full-year bimonthly schedule by selecting tasks for each period.
- Total minutes per visit is calculated and highlighted when over limit.

## Use
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Notes
The schedule is manual: pick tasks from the menu into each bimonthly period. The provided task menu auto-loads on first visit.
